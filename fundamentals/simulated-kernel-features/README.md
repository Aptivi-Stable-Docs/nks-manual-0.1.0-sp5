Within the simulated kernel, there are big amounts of features that actually excite you. As new versions get released, new and spectacular features get added.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some features of the kernel, such as the usage of SpecProbe driver, may need elevated privileges. To get access to these elevated privileges on Windows, use the `winelevate` command.

We advice that you don't restart Nitrocid as an elevated application unless absolutely necessary.
{% endhint %}

The buttons below lists some of the features that blow your mind.
